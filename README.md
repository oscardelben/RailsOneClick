# Rails One Click Install for Mac Os X (10.6 or higher)

Rails One Click is the perfect tool for installing and managing rails
applications.

Rails One Click is targeted at beginner who have little or no
programming experience, or developers who want to try rails but don't
want to bother about installing ruby and managing dependencies.

Rails one click creates a sandboxed Ruby environment accessible within
the app. When you're ready to move on simply delete the directory
created by Rails One Click.
